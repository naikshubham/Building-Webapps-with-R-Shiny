# Add a slider input to select year
# Slider inputs are great for numeric inputs, both when we'd like users to choose from a range of values and
# also when they should choose a static value from a set of options,
# but we want to be more creative than using a selectInput().

  sliderInput("year","select year", value=1900, min=1900, max=2010),
